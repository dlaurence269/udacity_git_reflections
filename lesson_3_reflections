-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-Whenever collaborating with other people, or when you know you won't have access to the same computer all the time.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-If GitHub automatically stayed up to date it may sync with things that aren't ready yet for public use.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-A branch is a split of a normal commit progression within a repository. A clone is coping a repository from one machine to another. A fork is a clone specifically from a repository on GitHub to GitHub.
