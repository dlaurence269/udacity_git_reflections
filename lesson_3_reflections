-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-Whenever collaborating with other people, or when you know you won't have access to the same computer all the time.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-If GitHub automatically stayed up to date it may sync with things that aren't ready yet for public use.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-A branch is a split of a normal commit progression within a repository. A clone is coping a repository from one machine to another. A fork is a clone specifically from a repository on GitHub to GitHub.

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-So that when you get a chance to reconnect with GitHub there's only a small difference to worry about, and you can merge your local changes with those of your collaborators.

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-It would overall be harder in pretty much all ways, especially between large groups.

-When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
-It's beneficial to make changes in a separate branch when doing something experimental that may not work, if collaborating with others and you don't want to change the master without them approving the changes. This is great in these situations. Making small iterative changes on a personal project can be done directly on master, which is always more simple.
